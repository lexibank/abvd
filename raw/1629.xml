	<notes>Possible loanword into Beothuk from Javanese
Beothuk is extinct language of Newfoundland Canada,  Algonquin-like but perhaps not Algic in origin. Perhaps a loan from the whaling period. See also Beothuk  
- methabeet 'cattle'
- nethabete 'cows and horses'

Compare with Javanese    
- sapi 'cow'

Native speaker wrote
ow-as-bosh-no-un ?  Whale's tail'  
(speaker included the ? suggesting perhaps
ow-as-bosh-un-no   
or
ow-as-posh-no-un ?   
(hard to tell if letter is a  b or p)

Compare with  
iwak paus buntot   'whale tail'  (Google
translate)  in Javanese which (speaker option) sounds to me like [ iwa paus bundo ]
